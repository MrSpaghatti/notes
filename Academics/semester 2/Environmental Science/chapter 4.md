Science - process used to solve problems or develop an understanding of nature that involves testing possible answers.

scientific method - way of gaining info about the world by forming possible solutions to questions, followed by rigorous testing to determine if the proposed questions are valid

correlation ARE NOT causations

Elements of the Scientific Method
--

scientific method requires a systematic search for info and continual evaluation to determine if previous ideas are still supported.
- scientific ideas undergo constant reevalutation, criticism, and modification.

observation - occurs when we use out senses or extensions of our senses to record and event
- scientists refer to observations as careful, thoughtful recognitions of events.

observations often lead to additional questions about the observations
- the way questions are asked will determine how one goes about answering them.

exploring other sources of knowledge is the next step to gain more info. 

Hypothesis - testable statement that provides a possible answer to a question, or an explanation for observation.
- a good hypothesis must be logical, account for all relevant information currently available, allow prediction of related future events, and be testable
	- given a choice, the simplest hypothesis with the fewest assumptions is the most desirable

Experiment - recreation of an event that enables an investigator to support of disprove a hypothesis
- controlled experiment divides the experiment into two groups (experimental and control) that differ by only one variable
Reproducibility is important to the scientific method. a good experiment must be able to be repeated by independent investigators to ensure a lack of bias.

when a broad consensus exists about an area of science, it is known as a theory or law.
- a theory is a widely accepted, plausible generalization about fundamental scientific concepts that explains why things happen.
- a scientific law is a uniform or constant fact of nature that describes what happens in nature.

communication - central characteristic of the scientific method
 - important part of the communication process involves the publication of articles in scientific journals about one's research, thoughts, and opinions.
 - this provides other scientists with an opportunity to criticize, make sugestions, or agree.

Pseudoscience - deceptive practice that uses the appearance or language of science to convince, confuse, or mislead people into thinking that something has scientific validity when it does not.

matter - anything that has mass and takes us space.
 - the kinetic molecular theory describes the structure and activity of matter.
	 - it states that all matter is made up of one or more kinds of smaller sub-units (atoms) that are in constant motion.

atom - fundamental unit of matter
92 types of atoms for in nature, with each being composed of:
 - protons (positive)
 - neutrons (neutral)
 - electrons (negative)
each kind of atom forms a specific type of matter known as an element

all atoms of the same element have the same number of protons and electrons, but may vary in the number of neutrons.

isotopes - atoms of the same element that differ from one another in the number of neutrons they contain.

molecules - atoms bonded together into stable units.

ions - electrically charged particles
- atoms that lose electrons = positively charged
- atoms that gain electrons = negatively charged

compounds - formed when two or more atoms or ions bind to one another.

mixtures - variable combinations of atoms, ions, or molecules.

subatomic particles:
1. proton - positively charged, in nucleus of atom
2. neutron - no charge, in nucleus of atom
3. electrons - negatively charged, outside of nucleus of atom
elements:
1. atoms - atoms of an element are composed of specific arrangements of protons, neutrons, and electrons
compounds:
1. composed of two or more atoms or ions chemically bonded together -- different compounds contain specific atoms or ions in specific proportions
mixtures:
1. atoms, molecules, or ions - the molecular particles in mixtures are not chemically bonded to each other. -- number of each kind of molecular particle present is variable.

acids, bases, and pH
--
acid - any compound that releases hydrogen ions in a solution

base - any compound that accepts hydrogen ions in a solution.

concentration of acid or base is called pH.
pH = -log(H+)
- the pH scale measure hydrogen ion concentration
- the scale is inverse and logarithmic
	- 7=neutral
	- 0-6=acidic (fewer OH- than H+)
	- 8-14 (more OH- than H+)

Organic Matter
--

organic matter consists of molecules that contain carbons atoms that are usually bonded to form rings or chains.
- all living things contain molecules of organic compounds.
- typically, chemical bonds in organic molecules contain a large amount of chemical energy that can be released when the bonds are broken.

Chemical Reactions
--
chemical bonds are attractive forces between atoms resulting from the interaction of their electrons.
- when chemical bonds are fromed or broken, a checmical reaction occurs.
- in exothermic reactions, chemical bonds in the new compounds contain less chemical energy than the previous compounds.
- in endothermic reactions, the newly formed chemical bonds contain more energy than the previous comounds.

activation energy is the initial input of energy required to start a reaction.
a catalyst is a sunstamce that alters the rate of reaction, without being consumed or altered itself in the process.
- catalysts can reduce activation energy
- a catalytic converter in an automobile brings about more complete burning of fuel, resulting in cleaner emissions.

chemical reactions in living things
--
living organisms contain enzymes that reduce the activation energy needed to start reactions

photosynthesis is a process used by plants to convert inorganic material into organic material using light.

respiration is the process that uses oxygen to break down large, organic molecules into smaller inorganic molecules (releases energy organisms can use)

energy principles
--
energy is the ability to perform work.

work is done whan an object is moved over a distance.
- kinetic energy is the energy contained by mobing objects.
- potential energy is energy due to its relative position.

sensible heat transfer occurs when heat energy flows froma  warmer object to a cooler object.
- the temp of cooler matter increases and the temp of warmer things goes down
latent heat transfer occurs when heat energy is used to change the state of matter, but the temp of matter does not change.

thermodynamics
--
1st law: energy cannot be created nor destroyed; merely transferred from one state to another.
2nd law: when converting energy from one form to another, some of the useful energy is lost.
- entropy is the energy that cannot be used to do useful work. 

environmental implications of energy flow
--
heat produced during energy conversion is dissipated into the environment.
- checmical reactions
- friction between moving objects
orderly arrangements of matter tend to become disordered. the process of becoming disordered coincides with the constant flow of energy toward a dilute form of heat.
- this results in an increase in entropy

forms of energy:
1. high quality - can be used to perform useful work (electricity)
2. low quality - cannot be used to perform useful work (heat in the ocean)
- temperature differential between two objects means that heat will flow from the warmer object to the cooler
- the greater the temp diff, the more useful work can be done
low quality energy still has significance in the world. 
- the distribution of heat energy in the ocean moderates the temp of coastal climates
- it contributes to weather patterns and causes ocean currents that are important in many ways.
we can sometimes figure new ways to convert low quality energy to high quality.
- improvements in wind turbines and photovoltaic cells allow us to convert low quality light and wind to electricity.


in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics, all organisms, including humans, are in the process of converting high-quality energy into low-quality energy.
- when chemical-bond energy in food is converting into the enrgy needed to move, grow, or respond, waste heat is produced.
	- from an energy POV, it is comparable to the process of combustion.

A consequence of energy conversion is pollution.
- wearing of brakes used to stop cars.
- emissions from power plants
if each person on earth used less energy, there would be less waste heat and other forms of pollution that result from energy conversion.

the amount of energy in the universe is limited. and only a small portion of that energy is high-quality.
