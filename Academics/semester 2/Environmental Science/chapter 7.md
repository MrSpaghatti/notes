## Key Points 
### Population Characteristics
- Population - group of individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area.
	- Genetic differences commonly exist within different populations of given species.
- Natality - the number of individuals added to a population through reproduction over a particular time period.
	- Birth rate = Humans born per 1000 individuals per year
- Mortality - The number of deaths in a population over a particular time period
	- death rate = humans deaths per 1,000 individuals per year
- survivorship curve - shows the proportion of individuals likely to survive to each age.
	- three types: 
	- species with high mortality in young
	- species with mortality equitable among age classes
	- species with mortality high only in old age
- population growth rate - birthrate minus death rate
	- often expressed as percentage of total population
- sex ration - relative number of males and females in a population.
	- the number of females is important because females determine the number of offspring produced in sexually reproducing populations
- age distribution - number of individuals of each age in the population
- population density - number of individuals per unit area.
	- high population density injures all individuals within the population because they compete severely for necessary resources.
		- dispersal - movement of individuals from densely populated locations to new areas
		- emigration - movement from an area
		- immigration - movement into an area
### A Population growth curve
- biotic potential is the inherent reproductive capacity of a species (biological ability to produce offspring)
	- generally, biotic potential is much higher than the number needed to replace parents
		- natural tendency to increase
- population growth follows a pattern consisting of a lag phase, an exponential growth phase, a deceleration phase, and a stable equilibrium phase.
	- lag phase - first portion of the curve; slow growth
	- exponential phase (log phase) - more organisms are reproducing, causing accelerated growth.
	- deceleration phase - population growth rate slows as the death rate and birth rate come to equal one another.
	- stable equilibrium phase - death rate and birth rate become equal and the population stops growing
### Factors that limit population size
- limiting factors - factors that prevent population growth
	- all of the different limiting factors that act on a population are collectively known as environmental resistance
	- extrinsic limiting factors are those that come from outside the population
		- predators
		- loss of food source
		- lack of sunlight
		- accidents of nature
	- intrinsic limiting factors are those that originate within the population and exercise control over it.
		- behavioral changes among the population cause lower birthrates and higher death rates.
	- density-dependent limiting factors - become more effective as the density of the population increases
	- density-independent limiting factors - influences not related to pop density
### Categories of Limiting Factors
- for most populations, limiting factors recognized as components of environmental resistance can be placed into 4 main categories:
	- raw material availability
	- energy availability
	- accumulation of waste products
	- interactions among organisms
### Carrying capacity
- carrying capacity is the maximum sustainable population for an area
	- can be influenced by environmental differences such as:
		- successional changes
		- climate variations
		- disease epidemics
		- forest fires, floods, or natural disasters
		- nutrient levels in aquatic ecosystems
### Reproductive Strategies and Population Fluctuations
- Species can be divided into two broad categories based on their reproductive strategies:
	- K-strategists - organisms that typically reach a stable population as the population reaches the carrying capacity
		- Usually occupy relatively stable environments
		- large organisms
		- long-lived
		- produce few offspring
		- provide substantial parental care
		- reproductive strategy is to invest a great deal of energy in producing a few offspring that have a good chance of living to produce
		- usually controlled by density-dependent limiting factors
	- r-strategists - typically these are small organisms that have a short life, produce many offspring, exploit unstable environments, and do not reach a carrying capacity.
		- little parental care
		- produce high numbers to overcome high mortality
		- controlled by density-independent limiting factors
