Ecological Concepts
--
Ecology - the study of ways organisms interact with each other and with their nonliving surroundings

Environment - everything that affects an organism during its lifetime.
- abiotic factors: nonliving things that influence an organism, such as energy, nonliving matter, living space, and ecoogical processes
- biotic factors: all forms of life with which the organism interacts.

Limiting factors - any factors whose shortage or absence restricts species success.
- scarcity of water, or nutrients
- climate, food availability
Range of tolerance indicates a range of conditions in which an organism can survive.
- some species have broader tolerance ranges than others.

Habitat - space in which an organism lives; it is defined by the biological requirements of each particular organism.
- usually highlighted by prominennt physical or biological features.
niche - functional role (profession) the organism has in its surroundings.
- includes all the ways an organism affects the organisms with which it interacts as well as how it modifies its physical surroundings.

Natural Selection and Evolution
--
Genes - distinct pieces of DNA that determine the characteristics an individual displays.

population - all organisms of the same kind found within a specific geographic region.
- contains more kinds of genes than any single individual within the population.

species - population of all the organisms potentially capable of reproducing naturally among themselves. 

natural selection - process that determines which individuals within a species will reproduce and pass their genes to the next generation.
- individuals within a species show genetically determined variation.
- organisms within a species typically produce more offspring than are needed to replace the parents when they die. most of the offspring die.
- the excess number of individuals results in a shortage of specific resources
- due to individual variation, some individuals have a greater chance of obtaining needed resources and therefore have a greater likelihood of surviving and reproducing than others.
- as time passes, the % of individuals showing favorable variations will increase while the % showing unfavorable variations will decrease.

evolution - the changes seen in the genes and characteristics displayed by successive generations of a population of organisms over time.

speciation - production of new species from previously existing species.
- thought to occur as a result of a species dividing into two isolated subpopulations.
extinction - loss of an entire species
- of the estimated 500 million species to ever have existed on earth, 98-99% have gone extinct
coevolution - concept that two or more species can reciprocally influence the evolutionary direction of the other.
- grazing animals and grass species

Kinds of Organism Interactions
--
Predation - kind of interaction in which one animal kills/eats another.
- predator benefits from food
- prey organism is harmed
- both predator and prey organisms show adaptations to their role.

competition - two organisms strive to obtain the same limited resource.
- intraspecific competition - competition between members of the same species
- interspecific competition - competition between members of different species
- competitive exclusion principle - no two species can occupy the same ecological niche in the same place at the same time.
	- less fit species must evolve into a slightly different niche, move to a different location, or go extinct

symbiosis - close, long-lasting, physical relationship between two different species. at least one species derives benefit from the interaction.
- parasitism - one organism (parasite) lives in or on another organism (host), from which it derives nourishment.
	- ectoparasites - live on host's surface
	- endoparasites - live inside host's body
- commensalism - one organism benefits and the other is unaffected
- mutualism - both species benefit.

Community and Ecosystem interactions.
--
Community - assemblage of all interacting species of organisms in an area.

ecosystem - defined space in which interactions take place between a community, with all its complex interrelationships, and the physical environment.

keystone species - plays critical role in maintenance of specific ecosystems.

3 main categories of organism roles:
- produces - organisms able to use sources of energy to make complex organic molecules from simple inorganic substances in their environment.
- consumers - organisms that require organic matter as a source of food.
	- primary consumers - herbivores; eat plants
	- secondary consumers - carnivores; eat animals
	- omnivores - eat both
- decomposers - organsisms that use nonliving organic matter as a source of energy and raw materials to build their bodies.

trophic level - each step in flow of energy through an ecosystem

as energy moves from one trophic level to another 90% of useful energy is lost as heat.

due to difficulty measuring the amount of energy contained in each trophic level, we often use **biomass** as a proxy metric.

food chain - series of organisms occupying different trophic levels through which energy passes as a result of one organism consuming another.

food web - multiple, overlapping, connected food chains

Photosynthesis: CO2 -> O2
Respiration: O2 -> CO2

carbon sinks - processes or situations that remove carbon atoms from active, short-term nutrient cycles and store them for extended time periods. examples: carbon stored as fossil fuels, sedimentary rock, long-lived plants

nitrogen cycle - cycling of nitrogen atoms between abiotic and biotic factors.

producers are unable to use atmospheric nitrogen (N2)

- must get nitrate (-NO3) or ammonia (NH3)

nitrogen fixing bacteria - convert nitrogen gas in to ammonia

Decomposers break down nitrogen-containing molecules, releasing ammonia

Nitrifying bacteria are abole to convert ammonia to nitrite, which can be converted to nitrate.

denitrifying bacteria are able (under anaerobic conditions) to convert nitrite into nitrogen gas which is ultimately released into the atmosphere.

the primary sink for nitrogen is the atmosphere.

too much nitrogen (used in fertilizer) gets carried into the aquatic systems, promoting the growth of algae and aquatic plants. 

too much or toxic algae can then kill fish or poison humans. 

more plants in water means less oxygen in water, causing dead zones.

phosphorus - mainly found in rocks.
- released by erosion and dissolve in water.
- plants use phosphorus to construct necessary molecules
- animals gain necessary phosphorus when they consume plants or other animals
- decomposers recycle phosphorus compounds back into the soil.
