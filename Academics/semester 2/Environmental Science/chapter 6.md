Biological Succession
--
succession - series of regular, predictable changes in community structure over time.

activities of organisms change their surroundings and make the environment suitable for other kinds of organisms.

climax community - relatively stable, long-lasting community that is the result of succession. the kind of climax community that develops is primarily determined by climate.

primary succession - begins with a total lack of organisms and bare mineral surfaces or water.

secondary succession - begins with the disturbance of an existing ecosystem.
- much more commonly observed, and generally proceeds more rapidly than primary succession.

Terrestrial primary succession:
- pioneer community is a collection of organisms able to colonize bare rock (lichens, etc.)
	- lichens help break down rock and accumulate debris, helping to form a thin soil layer. the soil layer begins to support small forms of life.
- each step in the process is known as a successional (seral) stage, and the sequence of stages is called a sere.

climax communities show certain characteristics when compared with successional communities.
- they maintain species diversity for an extended period. 
- they contain multiple specialized ecological niches,
- they maintain high levels of organism interactions
- they recycle nutrients while maintaining a relatively constant biomass.
- the general trend in succession is toward increasing complexity and more efficient use of matter and energy.

aquatic primary succession
- except for oceans, most aquatic systems are considered temporary.
- all aquatic systems recieve inputs of soil particles and organic matter from surrounding land.
- this results in the gradual fulling of shallow bodies of water.
	- roots and stems below water accumulate more material.
	- establishment of wet soil.

secondary succession occurs when an existing community is disturbed or destroyed but much of the soil and some of the organisms remain.
- because the soil and nutrients remain, this pricess can advance more rapidly than primary succession.
- plants and organisms that survive the disturbance can grow quickly and reestablish themselves.
- nearby undamaged communities can serve as sources of seeds and animals.
- the new climax community is likely to resemble the destroyed community.

Biomes
--
Biomes - terrestrial climax communities with wide geographic distributions.
- when different communities withing a biome are examined, they will show differences in the exact species present, but the general structure of the ecosystem and the kinds of niches and habitats present are similar throughout.
two primary non-biological factors have major impacts on the kinds of climax communities tha develop in any part of the world.
- temperature
- patterns of precipitation

patterns of precipitation and temperature are two primary nonbiological factors that have major impacts on the kind of climax community that develops in any part of the world.

the distribution of terrestrial ecosystems is primarily related to precipitation and temperature.
- temperature is warmest near the equator and cooler toward the poles.
- as altitude increases, average temperature decreases.
- moving from sea level to mountain tops, it is possible to pass through a series of biomes similar to what would be encountered moving from the equator to the north pole.

Deserts
---
- areas that average less than 25cm (10 inches) annual precipitation.
- unevenly distributed throughout the year.
- likely to be windy
- experience daily temperature fluctuations
- infrequent cloud cover
- many species, but they are present in low numbers
- many species exhibit specialized adaptations to climate such as the ability to conserve water.

- A lack of water is the primary factor that determines than an area will be a desert.

Temperate grasslands
---
- (prairies, steppes) are widely distributed over temperate parts of the world.
- they typically receive 25-75cm of annual precipitation.
- fire is an important force in preventing the invasion of trees and releasing nutrients from dead plants to the soil.
- the primary consumers are large herds of migratory grazing mammals, many insect species are also common.
- human impact:
	- Most of the moist grasslands of the world have been converted to agriculture.
	- most of the drier grasslands have been converted to the raising of domesticated grazers like sheep, cattle, and goats.
	- little undisturbed grassland is left, and those fragments that remain need to be preserved as refuges for the grassland species that once occupied huge portions of the globe.

savannas 
---
- found in tropical parts of africa, south america, and australia.
- characterized by extensive grasslands spotted with occasional patches of trees.
- recieve 50-150cm annual precipitation, unevenly distributed through year
	- rainfall patterns produce a seasonally structured ecosystem
- fire is common feature
- many trees are involved in nitrogen fixation
- heavily impacted by agriculture
- long droughts = hard to raise crops without irrigation.

Mediterranean shrublands
---
- located near oceans and are dominated by shrubby plants.
- their climate features wet, cool winters, and hot, dry summers.
- receive 40-100cm annual precip.
	- typical of mediterranean coast, coastal southern california, as well as parts of africa, chile, and australia.
- vegetation is dominated by woody shrubs adapted to hot, dry summers.
- fire is common
- very little undisturbed mediterranean shrublands still exists.
- agriculture is common with aid of irrigation
- major cities are located in this biome.

tropical dry forest
---
- heavily influenced by seasonal rainfall. found in central and south america, australia, africa, and asia.
	- 50-200cm annual precip.
	- many exhibit a monsoon climate with highly seasonal rainfall.
	- plants have developed special adaptation to survive drought.
- many of these forests occur in areas of very high human population.
- harvesting of wood for fuel and building materials has heavily affected these forests.
- much has been converted to farming or grazing.

Tropical rainforest
---
- located near the equator where temperature is relatively warm and constant. 
	- most areas receive 200+cm annual precip. and some 500+
	- soil allows high levels of leaching, thus most nutrients are tied up in biomass
	- tropical rainforests have a multi-layered canopy
		- epiphytic plants
	- also hosta  very high diversity of species
- human impact:
	- under intense pressure from logging and agriculture
	- many countries housing this kind of biome are poor and seek to obtain jobs and money by exploiting this resource.

Temperate deciduous forest
---
- typical of easter half of US, south-central and southeastern canada, southern africa, and many parts of europe and asia.
	- 75-100cm annual precip
	- usually lose their leaves during witner and replace them in spring.
- mild winters and long growing seasosn (6 months)
	- much fewer tree species than rainforests
- human impact:
	- much has been cleared for farming
	- periodic logging
	- big cities

temperate rainforests
---
- northern cali, washington, british columbia, southern alaska, new zealand, and southwest coast of chile.
- west winds bring moist air to coast. air is forced over mountains, cools, and rain or snow is produced.
- 130-300cm annual precip
- cool climate slows evaporation, generally damp area.
- fertile soil, mild temperatures, and water result in a lust growth of plants
- sitka spruce, douglas fir, and western hemlock are typical evergreen coniferous trees.
- old growth forests have trees 800 years old.
- deciduous alder, maple, and cotton wood occur in open areas with enough light.
- all trees are covered with mosses, frens, and other plants that grow on the surface of trees.
- dead trees fall to the ground and rot, providing a site for new tree growth. dead trees are called nurse trees.
- insects, as well as insect and fruit eating birds such as woodpeckers, chickadees, juncos, and warblers are common. 
- slugs are common on the forest floor.
- elk, black tail deer, bears, beavers, and owls are common. several species of salmon migrate seasonally up the streams and rivers to spawn.
- human impact:
	- at least half of original temperate rainforests have been logged
	- many remaining forests are scheduled to be logged
	- some patches have been protected because they are home to endangered northern spotted owls and the marbled murrelet, a seabird.

taiga, northern coniferous forest, or boreal forest
---
- throughout the southern half of canada, parts of northern europe, and much of russia, thee is an evergreen coniferous forest known as the taiga, norhtern coniferous forest, or boreal forest.
	- 25-100cm annual precip
- cool summers, long winters, lots of snow
- humid climate due to large amount of spring snowmelt; low temps reduce evaporation
- needle shaped leaves prevent water loss
- flexible branches to prevent snapping under weight of too much snow.
- human impact:
	- less severe because population density is low
	- logging is common
	- herding of reindeer occurs in northern scandinavia.

tundra
---
- north of the taiga is the tundra, and extremely cold region that lacks trees and has a permanently frozen subsurface.
	- permanently frozen soil layer is called permafrost
	- less than 25cm annual precip
- short, wet summer
- waterlogged soils and shallow ponds/pools are present in spring/summer
- plants are usually less than 20cm tall
- tundra like communities known as alpine tundra are found on mountaintops throughout the world.
- human impact:
	- few people live here
	- natives often rely on subsistence hunting for food
	- due to very short growing season, damage to this kind of ecosystem is slow to heal, so the land must be handled with great care.

# Major Aquatic Ecosystems
Shaped by key environmental factors:
- ability of the sun's rays to penetrate the water.
- depth of the water
- nature of the bottom substrate
- water temp
- amount of dissolved salts
	- low salts = freshwater ecosystem
	- high = marine ecosystem

marine ecosystem
- pelagic region - open sea above sea floor
- euphotic zone - upper layer of ocean where the sun's rays penetrate
- phytoplankton - microscopic plants floating in the ocean (photosynthesize)
- zooplankton - microscopic protozoa and animals that feed on phytoplankton
Benthic marine ecosystems
- benthic organisms - attached or non-attached, live on ocean floor
- substrate and temperature are very important characteristics in determining benthic community development
	- large plants and algae cannot become established in sifting sand substrate
	- mud usually contains little oxygen but is a good substrate for some kinds of rooted plants.
	- rocky surfaces in the ocean provide a good substrate for many kinds of algae
		- a profuse growth of algae is associated with a large variety of animals.
- an abyssal ecosystem is a bethic ecosystem that occurs at great depths in the ocean
	- no light = no photosynthesis
	- animals are scavengers; many are small and generate light for finding or attracting food.
- Coral reef ecosystems - primarily composed of coral animals that build cup-shaped external skeletons.
	- corals contain single-celled algae and carry on photosynthesis
	- require warm water, thus are found only near the equator
	- most require clear, shallow water with ample sunlight penetration.
- mangrove swamp ecosystems - tropical forest ecosystems that occypy shallow water near the shore and adjacent land.
	- their trees tolerate high salt content and excrete salt from their leaves
	- extensively developed roots that can extend above the water
	- the trees trap sediment in shallow areas, which results in the development of terrestrial ecosystems.
- estuaries - shallow, partially enclosed areas where freshwater enters the ocean.
	- organsism are specially adapted to varying levels of salinity from tides and river flow
	- extremely productive ecosystems because areas are shallow, warm, and nutrient rich
	- important nursery sites for fish and crustaceans.

# Freshwater ecosystems
- stationary water (lakes ponds and reservoirs)
	- littoral zone - region of a lake with rooted vegetation
		- emergent plants - have leaves that float on or protrude above the water's surface
		- submerged plants - stay submerged
	- limnetic zone - region of lake with no rooted vegetation
	- 

- running water (streams, rivers)
