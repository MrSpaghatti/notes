# Intro to Python 
**Date:** 02/04/2025
**Course:** Discovering Computer Science
**Summary:** [[Arithmetic Operators]]
## Key Points 
1. **Introduction to Arithmetic Operators**: It explains that Python has several arithmetic operators that follow the usual rules of mathematics.

2. **Basic Operators**: The video introduces the basic arithmetic operators:
   - `+` for addition
   - `-` for subtraction
   - `*` for multiplication
   - `/` for division

3. **Order of Operations**: It emphasizes that Python follows the mathematical order of operations, meaning multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction unless parentheses are used to change the order.

4. **[[Exponent]]iation**: The video explains how to raise a number to a power using `**`, and clarifies that the caret (`^`) does not perform exponentiation in Python.

5. **Modulo and Integer [[Division]]**: It covers the modulo operator (`%`), which returns the remainder of a division, and integer division (`//`), which rounds down to the nearest integer.
