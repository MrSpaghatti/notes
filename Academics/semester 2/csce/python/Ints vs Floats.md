**Date:** 02/04/2025
**Course:** Discovering Computer Science
**Summary:** 
## Key Points

1. **Types of Numbers**: It explains the difference between integers (whole numbers) and floats (numbers with decimal points) in Python.

2. **Division Results**: The video demonstrates that dividing one integer by another can result in a float, even if the division is exact.

3. **Data Types**: It discusses how integers and floats are two distinct data types in Python, and how you can check the type of a number using the `type()` function.

4. **Creating Integers and Floats**: The video shows how to create integers by simply writing whole numbers and how to create floats by including a decimal point.

5. **[[Type Conversion]]**: It explains how to convert between types using the `int()` and `float()` functions, highlighting that converting a float to an int truncates the decimal part without rounding.

6. **Use Cases**: The video provides examples of when to use integers (e.g., counting items) versus floats (e.g., measuring quantities).
