**Course:** Discovering Computer Science
**Summary:** 
## Key Points 
1. **Boolean Data Type**: It introduces the boolean data type, which can hold one of two values: `True` or `False`. These values are fundamental in programming and are often used in decision-making processes.

2. **Comparison Operators**: The video explains six common comparison operators in Python:
   - Less than (`<`)
   - Greater than (`>`)
   - Less than or equal to (`<=`)
   - Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
   - Equal to (`==`)
   - Not equal to (`!=`)

   These operators compare values and return a boolean result.

3. **Logical Operators**: It also covers three logical operators:
   - `and`: Evaluates to `True` if both conditions are true.
   - `or`: Evaluates to `True` if at least one condition is true.
   - `not`: Inverts the boolean value.

4. **Examples**: The video provides practical examples to demonstrate how to use these operators in Python, such as checking if a number is within a certain range.

5. **Real-world Applications**: It emphasizes the importance of booleans and operators in making decisions within your code.
