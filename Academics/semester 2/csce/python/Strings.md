## Key Points 
Strings in Python are shown as the variable type `str`. You can define a string with either double quotes `"` or single quotes `'`. If the string you are creating actually has one of these two values in it, then you need to be careful to assure your code doesn't give an error.

`>>> my_string = 'this is a string!' >>> my_string2 = "this is also a string!!!"`

You can also include a `\` in your string to be able to include one of these quotes:

`>>> this_string = 'Simon\'s skateboard is in the garage.' >>> print(this_string)`

`Simon's skateboard is in the garage.`

If we don't use this, notice we get the following error:

`>>> this_string = 'Simon's skateboard is in the garage.'`

  `File "<ipython-input-20-e80562c2a290>", line 1    this_string = 'Simon's skateboard is in the garage.'                          ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax`

The color highlighting is also an indication of the error you have in your string in this second case. There are a number of other operations you can use with strings as well. In this video you saw a few:

`>>> first_word = 'Hello' >>> second_word = 'There' >>> print(first_word + second_word) HelloThere  >>> print(first_word + ' ' + second_word) Hello There  >>> print(first_word * 5) HelloHelloHelloHelloHello  >>> print(len(first_word)) 5`

Unlike the other data types you have seen so far, you can also index into strings, but you will see more on this soon! For now, here is a small example. Notice Python uses 0 indexing - we will discuss this later in this lesson in detail.

`>>> first_word[0] H  >>> first_word[1] e`

#### The `len()` function

`len()` is a built-in Python function that returns the length of an object, like a string. The length of a string is the number of characters in the string. This will always be an integer.

There is an example above, but here's another one:

`print(len("ababa") / len("ab")) 2.5`

You know what the data types are for len("ababa") and len("ab"). Notice the data type of their resulting quotient here.
