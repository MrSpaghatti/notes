## Key Points 
In this video you were introduced to **methods**. **Methods** are like some of the **functions** you have already seen:

1. `len`("this")
2. `type`(12)
3. `print`("Hello world")

These three above are **functions** - notice they use parentheses, and accept one or more **arguments**. Functions will be studied in much more detail in a later lesson!

A **method** in Python behaves similarly to a function. Methods actually are functions that are called using dot notation. For example, `lower()` is a string method that can be used like this, on a string called "sample string": `sample_string.lower()`.

Methods are specific to the data type for a particular variable. So there are some built-in methods that are available for all [[Strings]], different methods that are available for all integers, etc.

Below is an image that shows some methods that are possible with any string.

Each of these methods accepts the string itself as the first argument of the method. However, they also could receive additional arguments, that are passed inside the parentheses. Let's look at the output for a few examples.

`>>> my_string.islower() True >>> my_string.count('a') 2 >>> my_string.find('a') 3`

You can see that the `count` and `find` methods both take another argument. However, the `.islower()` method does not accept another argument.

No professional has all the methods memorized, which is why understanding how to use documentation and find answers is so important. Gaining a strong grasp of the foundations of programming will allow you to use those foundations to use documentation to build so much more than someone who tries to memorize all the built-in methods in Python.

#### One important string method: `format()`

We will be using the `format()` string method a good bit in our future work in Python, and you will find it very valuable in your coding, especially with your `print` statements.

We can best illustrate how to use `format()` by looking at some examples:

**Example 1**

`print("Mohammed has {} balloons".format(27))`

**Example 1 Output**

`Mohammed has 27 balloons`

**Example 2**

`animal = "dog" action = "bite" print("Does your {} {}?".format(animal, action))`

**Example 2 Output**

`Does your dog bite?`

**Example 3**

`maria_string = "Maria loves {} and {}" print(maria_string.format("math", "statistics"))`

**Example 3 Output**

`Maria loves math and statistics`

Notice how in each example, the number of pairs of curly braces {} you use inside the string is the same as the number of replacements you want to make using the values inside `format()`.

More advanced students can learn more about the formal syntax for using the `format()` string method [here(opens in a new tab)](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/string.html#format-string-syntax).

### Another important string method: `split()`

A helpful string method when working with [[Strings]] is the .split method. This function or method returns a data container called a **list** that contains the words from the input string. We will be introducing you to the concept of lists in the next video.

The split method has two additional arguments (_sep_ and _maxsplit_). The _sep_ argument stands for "separator". It can be used to identify how the string should be split up (e.g., whitespace characters like space, tab, return, newline; specific punctuation (e.g., comma, dashes)). If the _sep_ argument is not provided, the default separator is whitespace.

True to its name, the _maxsplit_ argument provides the maximum number of splits. The argument gives maxsplit + 1 number of elements in the new list, with the remaining string being returned as the last element in the list. You can read more about these methods in the Python documentation too.

Here are some examples for the `.split()` method.

1. A basic split method:

```
``` new_str = "The cow jumped over the moon." new_str.split()``` 
Output is: ```Python ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'moon.']```  2. Here  the separator is space, and the maxsplit argument is set to 3. ```Python new_str.split(' ', 3) ``` Output is: ```Python ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over the moon.']```  3. Using '.' or period as a separator. ```Python new_str.split('.')``` Output is: ```Python ['The cow jumped over the moon', '']```  4. Using no separators but having a maxsplit argument of 3. ```Python new_str.split(None, 3)``` Output is: ```Python ['The', 'cow', 'jumped', 'over the moon.']```
```
