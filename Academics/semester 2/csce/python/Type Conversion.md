**Summary:** 
## Key Points 
You have seen four data types so far:

1. `int`
2. `float`
3. `bool`
4. `string`

You got a quick look at `type()` from an earlier video, and it can be used to check the data type of any variable you are working with.

`>>> print(type(633)) int >>> print(type(633.0)) float >>> print(type('633')) str >>> print(type(True)) bool`

You saw that you can change variable types to perform different operations. For example,

`"0" + "5"`

provides completely different output than

`0 + 5`

What do you think the below would provide?

`"0" + 5`

How about the code here:

`0 + "5"`

Checking your variable types is really important to assure that you are retrieving the results you want when programming.
