In our lives, seemingly insignificant events often hold substantial power over the course of our lives. My early fascination with technology serves as a prime example of this. It all began when I was just a toddler, exploring the world around me. The moment I tried to eat my mother’s phone, I inadvertently set the stage for a lifelong journey into the realm of computers and technology.

As a child, my attraction to technology was far stronger than my interest in traditional toys. I remember the allure of my mother’s phone—its shiny surface and glowing screen captivated me. I can vividly recall the moment I grasped it in my tiny hands, my instinctive urge to explore leading me to attempt the unthinkable: I put it in  my mouth. While this might seem like a harmless child’s curiosity, the blinking screen jump started my relationship with technology. Later on, I broke the keyboard of her laptop and, in a separate adventure, changed some combo of settings, causing it to speak Japanese at full volume. Each incident was a testament to my innate desire to understand how things worked, no matter the consequences. 

By the age of five, my exploration took a significant turn when I downloaded Minecraft on my mother’s iPad. What began as a simple game became a catalyst for deeper engagement with technology. I delved into the settings of the device, absorbing random bits of knowledge and skills that would prove invaluable. My family soon recognized my knack for technology and began seeking my help with their devices. This early experience allowed me to build a mental database of tips and tricks, equipping me with the skills to analyze problems and devise logical solutions, laying the groundwork for my future aspirations in computer science.

Entering sixth grade was a pivotal moment. I was required to have a laptop for my schooling, and I instantly fell in love with its potential. Just as I had with my mother's iPad, I began to explore its capabilities, leading me to teach myself about the ins and outs of programming languages, networking, and operating systems. This event is what first sprouted the idea of a computer based career. The laptop became an extension of myself, a tool for both learning and creativity.

Now, as a college freshman, the gravity of those seemingly insignificant decisions is clearly visible as I am a majorly self-taught CyberSecurity major, and ahead of the curve compared to my peers in the industry. The simple act of chewing on a phone created a massive butterfly effect, teaching me that every action, even ones that seem unimportant, can drastically change the course of someone's life, for better or for worse.
