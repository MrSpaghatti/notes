###### Reflecting on Defining Moments

	Life is a series of significant events that shape who we are and will be. Each experience, whether it seems monumental at the time or not, contributes to our growth and understanding of life and how to navigate it. Reflecting on major events like these can provide valuable insights into how they have influenced our development. To show how our views of an event may change with time, I have written about 3 major events that I feel changed the course of my development as a person. 
	Throughout the final two years of my middle school experience, I was very active in the wind symphony. I was a dedicated yet self-doubting musician, reluctant to commit to any competitions or tournaments due to my struggles with self-motivation. But during 8th grade, my final year attending that school, I finally entered into a competition. The competition was a result of my band director's insistence, driven by a desire to push me beyond my comfort zone. Since we had to learn and perform four symphonic pieces to perfection within three days, I was a little too caught up in all the chaos around me to fully appreciate the significance of the experience, but now I understand that I was being shown what perseverance can bring you. In retrospect, that was when I learned the value of pushing through challenges and the joy of finishing a hard job.
	Receiving my first computer was a landmark moment in my life. Prior to this, I had always been fascinated by technology but had more more limited access to it. We had to get a laptop for me because my school required it, but it was a massive deal to me at the time. This new freedom to explore, tinker with, and customize technology opened up a world of possibilities that I didn't fully appreciated at the time. My younger self was too focused on making my laptop look cool to realize that it would become a crucial tool for learning and personal growth.
	Switching schools and moving to a different city felt like my life was just flipped upside down. Before, I was a student who enjoyed school and had a good group of friends. The move happened because we couldn’t afford to stay where we were, and it made me become emotionally distant and less interested in school. I lost my friends and a place where I felt happy, and my parents had to work even more. At the time, I didn’t fully understand how losing my supportive environment and facing a new, unwelcoming place would affect me. Looking back, I see that this change was not just about moving to a new location but also about dealing with emotional and mental challenges. I didn’t realize then how this experience would shape my attitude toward school and my ability to cope with change.
	Reflecting on these defining moments reveals how they have shaped my journey and understanding of myself. Winning the music competition taught me about the rewards of perseverance, getting my first computer opened doors to new opportunities, and switching schools highlighted the challenges of adjusting to significant life changes. Each experience has contributed to my growth, offering lessons that were not always apparent in the moment but have become clear with time. Understanding these experiences helps me appreciate the complexity of personal development and the ways in which we can learn and evolve from our past.
