Throughout this semester, my journey as a student has been marked by fundamental addition, particularly in how I approach brainstorming and pre-writing. Before I stepped into college, I viewed writing as a waste of my time; I've always been fairly skilled at writing but I was never too fond of it. However, thanks to Mr. Marsh and this class I've been able to find meaning for my writing.

One of the most profound changes has been in my approach to research. I’ve learned that effective research isn’t just about gathering information; it’s about engaging with sources critically and forming meaningful connections between you and your research. My paper on addiction taught me that not all the info I need can be easily found on the internet; sometimes you have to actually talk to people in order to understand more deeply and consider multiple perspectives.

My growth as a writer has been equally significant. Initially, I struggled with the introductory and conclusive paragraphs, but through consistent practice and valuable information and examples from my professor, I’ve developed a more structured and analytical approach to writing those aspects of my papers. I’ve learned that good writing is really about rewriting - a lesson that has transformed my entire pre-writing process. Instead of simply writing my rough draft once, I now write as much as I can for five minutes, reread what I just wrote, and then repeat the process until I have a good outline to shape into a respectable paper.

Looking back, there are areas where I could have improved upon but the circumstances were out of my control for the most part. I wish I had been more proactive in seeking feedback and participating in class discussions throughout the semester. However, I’m proud of how I’ve grown in my pre-writing.

Regarding my place in the college community, I’ve found that due to all that I've had going on this semester, along with my commute being so long, I haven't really had a chance to really feel like a part of the UNT community yet. As I further my learning and experience here I hope to meet new people and spend more time here.

This semester has reshaped my relationship with writing in ways I never expected. From viewing it as a tedious task to discovering it as a valuable tool for expression and learning, my journey has been transformative. While I may not have fully integrated into the UNT community yet due to my long commute and busy schedule, I’ve grown significantly in my academic abilities. The pre-writing strategies and research skills I’ve developed will serve me well in both my future courses and professional endeavors. Most importantly, I’ve learned that meaningful writing isn’t just about the final product—it’s about the process of discovery along the way.
