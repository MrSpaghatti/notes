"Is the pain worth the gain?"
This thesis statement employs multiple techniques to draw the reader in; the most obvious example being the interrogative format. Phrasing the thesis statement as a question acts as a sort of guide for the reader to question the subject on their own, allowing for more interest in the bulk of the paper.

This statement could definitely be improved upon; it could be updated to include more specific information about the direction of the paper. But, for the level of interest curried by such a low effort hook, it is a fairly efficient and performative option.


A thesis statement's main purpose is to introduce the reader to the direction or main idea of the paper while gaining the reader's interest in the topic being written about. They generally employ multiple techniques that are meant to introduce the topic in a way that engages the reader's curiosity or imagination.
Thesis statements should not only be concise and clear, but also draw the reader in by questioning or debating the topic. 

The harshest conditions can often produce the brightest diamonds.
