4. What do you relate to in this song? Why do these things resonate with you? 
    The aspect that resonates most with me is the nostalgia; the ache for what once was. Even since way before I even understood the truth to my words, I have been saying that I didn't want to grow up. As a toddler, I already knew that childhood is better but I didn't really understand why. Now that I do, I wish I could go back to the time when I couldn't grasp all these oppressive and negative concepts.
